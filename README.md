[Data Science] Disasters in South Eastern Asia?

Project Overview
Southeast Asia is one of the most hazard-prone regions about disasters in Asia and the Pacific. The region often suffered the impacts of typhoons, storm surges, floods, drought, and earthquakes. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the types of disasters in Southeast Asia, which regions are frequently affected. Moreover, I would like to understand more about disasters in Vietnam.

Data Description
The disaster data set from the early 20th century to 2021 was collected by EM-DAT â€“ Emergency Events Database. EM-DAT was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government.

The dataset includes attributes such as disaster group, disaster type, disaster name, year, country, location, longitude, latitude, local time, start day, end day, total deaths and total affected...etc

EDA Goals
Looking at the attributes above and the data, I formulate the following questions:

Which country is most affected by disasters?
What type of disaster occurs most often?
In VietNam, are the central provinces suffering the most natural disasters? Which province have the most affected?
